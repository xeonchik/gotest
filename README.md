# About it

This is the draft or prototype of an in-memory database,
that supports a set of different index types.

* Primary key indexes
* Multi-valued indexes
* Flat-indexes

Also, I want to add index merge (or intersect) functionality,
that would use all indexes together.

### Features supported:
* Data persistence layer
* REST API
* 

I'm working on new features and performance.
In a near future, I would like to add replication,
WAL (Write Ahead Log), transactions support, FlatBuffer/Protobuf
TCP socket communications, MapReduce algorithms between the peers.
